⚠️**WARNING**

I still don't know if this will work on the newest Doors game as I haven't updated it nor tested it yet. Use at your own risk and ask for support at Async#4226 (Discord)

Script: ```loadstring(game:HttpGet"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheCtkHoster/Doors-Script/main/source.lua")()```
